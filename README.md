SQL-Challenge 

The propose of this project is to research the people employed during the 1990’s and19 80’s, given the remaining files in the database from the selected years.

The dependencies required for this project are PGadmin,SQL, Python, csvfiles

The first step to start this project was to develop a schema for the 6 csvfiles provided. 
 accomplished developing an ERD To map out the Primary Keys and Foreign keys to map out the data. I then used the ERD to create a schema using Python SQL.

 created tables from each csvfile to filter and connect the data.

 created a database in PGadmin to answer the questions provided. 

 imported the schema created into Pgadmin to create tables.

 developed a query to answer the questions. 

 ran query.

 results, I was able the to answer the questions using the query tool,but 
 the data provided seemed to be incorrect, the same first name was displayed 20 times within the data, repeating itself.
